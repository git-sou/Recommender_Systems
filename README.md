# Recommender_Systems

Recommender systems can be classified into 3 types:
- Simple recommenders: offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on popularity and/or genre.

- Content-based recommenders: suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, author, description, etc. to make 
these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is 
similar to it.

- Collaborative filtering engines: these systems try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of 
other users. Collaborative filters don't require item metadata.
